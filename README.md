# CoronaWashNews
Stay informed and wash your hands well while Covid19 goes around!

It's very important to keep your hands clean, that's why we've published this app.

The App implements a counter (about 30 seconds) while you wash your hands. So you can see how long you washed your hands - that's really useful in times where we have to stop the spread of the Virus.

Also you have linked in the App the News from offical sources, so no Fake News. We host them in Pastebins as JSON Format - it's no secret that we have manually implement it on that way, without a large Database.
